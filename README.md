Sopify Central Discount Billboard App

Acts as a billboard for Shopify Merchants to post their discounted products and special offers.

Goals:
- To create a shared marketplace and add a new feature to Shopify as a shopping mall
- To increase the traffic of young and/or small shopify stores
- To facilitate the Shopifyâ€™s merchants marketing
- To help customers find their favourite products with less efforts and for less price

This app has been created using:

* dev
* Ruby version 2.6.5
* Rails 6
* Bootstrap 4.3
* Whenever gem
* Bootstrap-datepicker


 
 * Please use following commands to run the app:
  1- dev up
  2- dev s
  
  * Important note:
  The main idea of creating this app was to create a Shopify app. But because of some technical problems and time constraint I needed to create it as an stand alone project. As a Shopify app it only needs a class of "Advertisement" and has  access to the shops(stores), products and products' collections info through Shopify APIs. So the "Store" and "Collection" classes are only to simulate those APIs and to fill the "advertisements" table.
